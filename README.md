## the journey

All of our information travels into our frontal lobe of our brain where rational, logical thinking takes place.  All of that information passes through the limbic system along the way.  The limbic system is where emotions take place.  We experience our external information emotionally before our reason can kick into gear.  The communication between your emotional and rational "brains" is the physical source of emotional intelligence (EQ).

- (Gavin) - note that Jonathan Haidt in the Righteous Mind talks about reason being an elephant rider that mostly justifies what the elephant does.

People with the highest levels of IQ outperform those with average IQs just 20 percent of the time while people with average IQs outperform those with high IQs 70 percent of the time.  This anomaly threw a massive wrench into what many people had always assumed was the source of success - IQ.  Studies point to EQ being a critical factor.

- (Gavin) - Carnegie in How to Win Friends and Influence People understood that IQ wasn't the primary factor for success.  I think the insights of Haidt and Carnegie are related.  The goal of being successful is related to influencing people at an emotional level.  Most people dont' have the kind of mind which is rational and reasonable (Haidt might say nobody has a mind that is rational and reasonable).  It is the limbic system which is moving individuals and groups.  **It leads to the conclusion that leaders must specialize in speaking to people's limbic systems.**
