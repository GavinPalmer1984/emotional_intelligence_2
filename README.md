## the journey

All of our information travels into our frontal lobe of our brain where rational, logical thinking takes place.  All of that information passes through the limbic system along the way.  The limbic system is where emotions take place.  We experience our external information emotionally before our reason can kick into gear.  The communication between your emotional and rational "brains" is the physical source of emotional intelligence (EQ).

- (Gavin) - note that Jonathan Haidt in the Righteous Mind talks about reason being an elephant rider that mostly justifies what the elephant does.

People with the highest levels of IQ outperform those with average IQs just 20 percent of the time while people with average IQs outperform those with high IQs 70 percent of the time.  This anomaly threw a massive wrench into what many people had always assumed was the source of success - IQ.  Studies point to EQ being a critical factor.

- (Gavin) - Carnegie in How to Win Friends and Influence People understood that IQ wasn't the primary factor for success.  I think the insights of Haidt and Carnegie are related.  The goal of being successful is related to influencing people at an emotional level.  Most people dont' have the kind of mind which is rational and reasonable (Haidt might say nobody has a mind that is rational and reasonable).  It is the limbic system which is moving individuals and groups.  **It leads to the conclusion that leaders must specialize in speaking to people's limbic systems.**

## the big picture

Emotions are derivations of five core feelings: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and shame.

- (Gavin) - Feelings of shame and fear are extremely rare for me.  If the individual does not have these feelings then they may be less likely to identify them in other people.  I think people's personality type may be related to EQ - and society may be selecting certain personalities over other personalities.  I suspect that there is in essense a prejudice against certain personalities in positions of influence and power.  And I suspect this is a reason for much suffering in our world: prejudice against some personalities and favoritism toward other personalities.

As your EQ skills grow you'll learn to spot your triggers and practice productive ways of responding that will become habitual.

Unlike IQ, EQ can be developed and learned.  EQ can be developed even if you aren't born with it.

- (Gavin) - If everyone has good self awareness and self control then people wouldn't need be careful about what they say for fear of causing the wrong emotional response in others.  It's like we must learn to be careful about what we say because most other people don't have good self awareness and self control.

Personality can't be used to predict EQ.

- (Gavin) - A few sentences prior, the author said that some people naturally have higher EQ than others.  So there is something about a person that allows some people to start off with more EQ than others even if the author claims that EQ can be developed in everyone.  Some people will have advantages over others.  I have read that some personalities would have advantages over other personalities.  I have read Dr. A J Drenth's INTP book because I am an INTP.  Based on my reading - the INTP can acquire good EQ but it will probably be in their 30s, 40s, or 50s.  Because of this, the young INTP is not put into influential and powerful leadership positions in our society.

- (Gavin) - Is it good to have people with low IQ and high EQ end up in positions of influence and power?  I think you ideally want to select people with high IQ and high EQ and the right character for positions of influence and power.  Start With Why by Simon Sinek speaks toward character and this EQ 2.0 book seems to ignore character when "considering the whole person".

Those who score low in EQ can catch up with those who score high in EQ.

- (Gavin) - I would bet that the data would show disparities between personality types, IQ, and age.

## what emotional intelligence looks like: understanding the four skills

The four skills pair up under two categories: personal and social.  The personal is made up of self awareness and self management skills.  The social is your ability to understand other people's moods, behavior and motives in order to improve the quality of your relationship.

- (Gavin) - If all people were good at the personal category then the social category would not be as important.  I think some personalities will be naturally stronger or weaker in one category or the other.

Listening and observing are the most important elements of social awareness.

Relationship management often taps into your abilities in the first three emotional intellgience skills: self-awareness, self-management, and social awareness.

Solid relationships are something that should be sought and cherished.  The difference between an interaction and a relationship is a matter of frequency.  It's a product of the quality, depth, and time you spend interacting with another person.

Relationship management poses the greatest challenge for most people during times of stress.

Conflicts at work tend to fester when people passively avoid problems because people lack the skills needed to initiate a direct yet constructive conversation.

- (Gavin) - If I rarely feel fear and shame then I will have more difficulty recognizing it in others.  And so the development of self awareness and self control can lead to situations where it becomes harder to have social awareness.
